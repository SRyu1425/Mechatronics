# Mechatronics Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects centered around mechatronics, embedded systems, and control systems, mainly using the Raspberry Pi Pico and Raspberry Pi Camera, while programming in C and Python. 

## Topics Covered

### Embedded Systems
- Configuring and using ADC, PWM, I2C, UART, and SPI interfaces.
- Handling tasks such as sensor readings, motor control, and data communication with peripheral devices.

### Hardware Interfacing
- Direct interaction with sensors, actuators, and displays (like OLED screens and servos).
- Implementing motor control using PWM signals, and integrating components like DACs for more complex setups.

### Signal Processing
- Applying digital filters such as Finite Impulse Response (FIR), Infinite Impulse Response (IIR), and moving average filters.
- Using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to analyze signals in the frequency domain, showing insights into signal characteristics and behavior.

### Data Acquisition and Processing
- Using ADC and serial communication to gather and process data in real-time.
- Visualizing data with Python and Matplotlib, allowing easier analysis and interpretation of sensor readings.

### Control Systems
- Designing proportional controllers, like those used in line-following robots.
- Fine-tuning control parameters to achieve desired performance in various scenarios.

### Image Capture and Processing
- Simple image manipulation and analysis tasks using a camera and the Raspberry Pi Zero

### Communication Protocols
- Establishing reliable communication channels between devices using I2C, SPI, and UART and combining multiple communication methods in integrated systems
